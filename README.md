# Basic smart contract:
## Description:
	This is a basic Lottery based smart contract. It allows multiple users to bet certain amount of ether on a public pool. The winner of the Lottery will be chosen randomly by manager (account deployed the smart contract). All the ether collected will be then transferred to the winner's account. 
## Whats in there anyway?
	1. Smart contract solidity code.
	2. Smart contract compiling using solc codes.
	3. uint testing with Mocha + Chai. [Here we deploy in local network using ganache-cli].
	4. Deploying into Infura / local network code is under progress.....(will be uploaded shortly).
## Prerequisite:
1. Be sure that you have installed node.js in your system (using git bash for windows is highly recommended).
	step 1: npm i node@lts
	step 2: node init
2. Install the following packages as follows (look dependencies)
 
3. Now your working folder should be looking like this (If you can specify paths easily, then you can follow your own folder path structure.) .. Note:- [don't add gits folder!!!]
 
4. Well that is all, node_modules folder will be not here in my repository (npm package gets it for you)... Take a look into the project. Detailed comments are provided for clear understanding before each piece of code. You can do it.

## Whats next?
	Very detailed project on smart contract involving 
		> CryptoKitties/ CryptoZombies
		> Kickstarter.com campaign releated project
is on the way. I'll be uploading detailed documentation for that, so that you don't get lost in code. Don't hesitate to contact. Looking forward.:+1:
